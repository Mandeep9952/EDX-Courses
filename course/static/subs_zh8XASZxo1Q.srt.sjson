    "is essentially his wages and then he bought", 
    "all of the goods and services he needed", 
    "from that same firm.", 
    "So, his expenditures would be the revenue", 
    "of that firm and then the revenue of that firm", 
    "would be turned into the expenses", 
    "and the profit of the firm, so whatever the", 
    "revenue wasn&#39;t used in expenses ended up", 
    "being profit.", 
    "Then all of that went back to that one", 
    "household as income.", 
    "When we talked about how we would measure", 
    "the economic activity in this island", 
    "right over here, how would we measure its", 
    "gross domestic product, we said,", 
    "well look we could measure it in multiple", 
    "different ways.", 
    "As it&#39;s leaving his hands, the dollars that is", 
    "going to the firm, you could view it as the", 
    "total expenditures, or as it&#39;s approaching", 
    "the firm that&#39;s the same thing as the total", 
    "revenue for this firm, total revenue for this", 
    "simplified, one firm economy.", 
    "That total revenue is the same thing as the", 
    "total expenses plus the profit for that firm.", 
    "That&#39;s the same thing as this one", 
    "households income.", 
    "So, let me write this down.", 
    "The way we looked at it in the last video,", 
    "in the very simple example, GDP was equal to", 
    "household, household expenditures which was equal", 
    "to firm, firm revenues which was equal to firm", 
    "expenses, expenses plus profit,",

    "and of course household income is then,", 
    "at least in this case right over here,", 
    "it ended up being equal to household expenses.", 
    "What I want to do in this video now is", 
    "think about it in more general terms.", 
    "Let&#39;s extend it to a more complex economy,", 
    "to the world we live in and with that I want to look", 
    "at the more formal definition for GDP.", 
    "This is the more formal definition of GDP,", 
    "or I guess you could say the definition of GDP", 
    "and it&#39;s the market value of all final goods", 
    "and services, and we&#39;re going to talk about what", 
    "each of these things mean ... of all, of all", 
    "final goods and services.", 
    "I&#39;ll underline all separately, all final goods", 
    "and services.", 
    "Let me do that in a different color.", 
    "... all final goods and services produced within", 
    "a country, produced within a country", 
    "in a given period.", 
    "You can have a GDP for a month,", 
    "you could have a GDP for a quarter of a year", 
    "which would be three months or you could have", 
    "the GDP in a given year.", 
    "I guess you could even have GDP over a", 
    "10 year period, but it tends to be", 
    "we always think of GDP in terms of annual GDP", 
    "or quarterly GDP or sometimes even ...", 
    "so there are some estimates of even monthly GDP", 
    "but it tends to be annually or quarterly.", 
    "Let&#39;s parse a little bit more because these", 
    "little terms can be interesting.", 
    "The first one I&#39;d like to parse is the idea of", 
    "market value.", 
    "(writing) Market value.", 
    "What this is saying is we need someway to measure", 
    "what we&#39;ve produced and the best way we can", 
    "do it is say, how much benefit are people getting", 
    "and what they&#39;re willing to pay for it in the", 
    "market is the best way that we can measure", 
    "how much benefit they&#39;re actually getting", 
    "out of it.", 
    "For example, if someone in the year,", 
    "I don&#39;t know, if an avocado was produced,", 
    "if an avocado is produced in some farm", 
    "and also an orange is produced,", 
    "and an orange is produced,", 
    "we won&#39;t say that for each of these,",

    "demand for avocado&#39;s goes down or whatever",

    "as the previous year, now all of a sudden", 
    "the contribution from avocado&#39;s might be the same", 
    "as a contribution from oranges.", 
    "It really depends on the market value.", 
    "Then we can focus on this all, the market value of all", 
    "goods and services, all goods and services.", 
    "We would do all the different avocado&#39;s", 
    "and oranges, but we would do computers,", 
    "we would do cars, we would do tires,", 
    "and we&#39;re doing services, so if you have help", 
    "at home, if you go to the doctor;", 
    "the market value of all of those things are going to",

    "And you&#39;re also not keeping track of goods",

    "the household and consumed within the household.", 
    "For example, if you hire an outside person", 
    "to babysit your child that would be considered", 
    "part of GDP, that is a service that you are", 
    "paying for, but if you, yourself, are babysitting",

    "All does include pretty much everything that", 
    "can be tracked, anything where there is an", 
    "exchange of money, there&#39;s some payment",

    "Now a really interesting thing",

    "when I first got exposed to GDP,",
