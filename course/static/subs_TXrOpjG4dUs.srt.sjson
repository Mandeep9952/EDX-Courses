    "that maybe there was some bad investment,", 
    "that people&#39;s investments weren&#39;t turning", 
    "out as good as they expected.", 
    "People get a little anxious, but then as you",

    "then desperate, then panic,",

    "if you think of a stock market cycle,", 
    "really start to sell in the case of a", 
    "regular business cycle,", 
    "they start to maybe underspend,", 
    "they start to really hoard things,", 
    "then capitulation ... This is when they say, &#39;", 
    "&quot;Things are just bad. They&#39;re never going", 
    "to get any better,&quot; and then they become", 
    "despondent and eventually, you could even say,",
