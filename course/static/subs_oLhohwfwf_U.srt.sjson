    "Maybe it&#39;s the market for candy bars,", 
    "so this is the market for candy bars.", 
    "We&#39;ve seen this many, many, many times,", 
    "this is most of what we were doing", 
    "when we were studying microeconomics.", 
    "On the vertical axis, we would",

    "the candy bar and the horizontal axis", 
    "you would have the quantity bought or sold",

    "That very first few units of candy bars",

    "The first is called the &quot;wealth effect.&quot;", 
    "Let me write these down.", 
    "The first is called the &quot;wealth effect.&quot;", 
    "The wealth effect is just saying,",

    "&quot;Prices have gone down,", 
    "wages have gone down, maybe",

    "People have the same savings.", 
    "They have the same amount of money", 
    "in their wallet.", 
    "If that happens, all things equal,", 
    "now they say, &quot;With the same amount of", 
    "money that I have in my wallet,", 
    "I can now buy more. I feel wealthier.&quot;", 
    "That&#39;s the wealth effect.", 
    "They will say, &quot;I will go and demand more", 
    "goods and services because with what I have", 
    "in my pocket, I can go buy more things.&quot;", 
    "Likewise, if for whatever reason people", 
    "woke up the next morning ...", 
    "Remember, all other things equal,", 
    "if the price of everything were to double,", 
    "they say, &quot;Oh my God! I can&#39;t buy anything", 
    "anymore. Everything&#39;s too expensive.", 
    "I have to buy less of it. I&#39;m going to", 
    "demand fewer goods and service.&quot;", 
    "The wealth effect is one theory", 
    "that would explain, all other things equal,", 
    "why you would have a downward sloping", 
    "aggregate demand curve.", 
    "The other one is related to interest rates.", 
    "I would call it savings and interest rate effect.", 
    "Interest rate effect.", 
    "You can imagine, if before this bar", 
    "represented the total amount of money", 
    "someone had in their pockets,", 
    "and this is how much they needed to spend", 
    "on goods and services in order to have", 
    "a nice, happy, productive life,", 
    "this is originally what they were", 
    "going to save, now all of a sudden,", 
    "now if all of a sudden if things get", 
    "a lot cheaper, they don&#39;t have to", 
    "spend this much on goods and services.", 
    "They could spend less", 
    "on goods and services.", 
    "Maybe if things got a lot cheaper,", 
    "they could spend less on goods and services.", 
    "Now they could spend maybe this amount", 
    "on goods and services,", 
    "and they could save much more.", 
    "Right over here ... Remember,", 
    "all other things equal,", 
    "if everyone woke up tomorrow", 
    "and things were just half priced,", 
    "people would be able to spend less", 
    "on the things they need,", 
    "and they would be able to save a lot more money.", 
    "We&#39;ve seen before, savings,", 
    "when people save money, it just goes into", 
    "the financial system.", 
    "You save it, you put it into the bank,", 
    "and it just gets lent out to other people.", 
    "So when you have increase in savings,", 
    "all other things equal,", 
    "when prices goes down,", 
    "all other things equal,", 
    "then savings go up which means", 
    "that the supply of money to be lent,", 
    "supply of lenders or money to be lent,", 
    "money lending goes up.", 
    "We saw that in a previous video.", 
    "If you increase the supply of money", 
    "that can be lent, the price of", 
    "borrowing the money will go down.", 
    "Another way to think about it,", 
    "interest rates.", 
    "Interest rates will go down.", 
    "When interest rates go down,", 
    "it becomes cheaper,", 
    "you have to spend less interest", 
    "to borrow money and make investments.", 
    "Borrow money, build a house.", 
    "Borrow money, build a factory.", 
    "Borrow money, do whatever ... buy inventory.", 
    "Interest rates go down,", 
    "that stimulates investment,", 
    "that stimulates investment,", 
    "which once again, would cause", 
    "the economy to expand.", 
    "You would have more goods and services", 
    "being produced.", 
    "Likewise, if you went the other way,", 
    "if prices went up,", 
    "this is a situation where prices went down.", 
    "if prices went up, now all of a sudden,", 
    "people have to spend more of their money.", 
    "More of their money on the things", 
    "that they maybe think that they need", 
    "to survive and be happy.", 
    "There will be less savings.", 
    "If there&#39;s less savings,", 
    "there&#39;s less money to be lent.", 
    "There will be higher interest rates", 
    "and there will be less investment,", 
    "so the economy will contract.", 
    "So real GDP ... And remember,", 
    "when I say GDP here, maybe I&#39;ll call it real GDP,", 
    "real GDP would go down.", 
    "This is real GDP would go up.", 
    "The third theory of why ...", 
    "or the third justification because", 
    "economists like to have this downward", 
    "sloping curve so that they can justify,", 
    "and we&#39;ll see how aggregate supply", 
    "and demand can cause business cycles,", 
    "the third effect is essentially,", 
    "I&#39;ll call it a foreign exchange effect.", 
    "A foreign exchange effect.", 
    "Foreign exchange.", 
    "Based on the line of reasoning,", 
    "so let&#39;s say a situation once again where", 
    "prices went down,", 
    "based on their line of reasoning and", 
    "justification, we said if prices go down,", 
    "then interest rates go down because", 
    "there&#39;s more money to be lent", 
    "in that economy in that currency.", 
    "If interest rates go down,", 
    "investors might say,", 
    "&quot;I only get low interest in my country.",
