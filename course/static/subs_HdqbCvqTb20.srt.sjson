    "Aggregate Supply model fits the description", 
    "of what actually happened. One could argue", 
    "you don&#39;t need the ADAS model to describe what happened,", 
    "but we should at least make sure that it does", 
    "describe what happened. If we go to 1960,", 
    "this is the very end of the Eisenhower administration.", 
    "Eisenhower was a Republican in office. The only", 
    "reason why I give his party affiliation is because", 
    "if the economy is weak, and in 1960 the economy", 
    "was weak and one can always debate whether", 
    "it was due to the government or whether", 
    "it was due to just the natural fluctuations", 
    "in the economy, but in general, when the economy", 
    "is weak, it tends to go against the party", 
    "that is in power. In 1960, the Republicans", 
    "were in power. There was a recession. One could", 
    "argue that was a major reason why the Democratic", 
    "candidate in the 1960 election was able to win,", 
    "John F. Kennedy. In 1961, JFK is inaugurated.", 
    "He becomes President of the United States.", 
    "One of his top goals is to try to turn around", 
    "this economy. He does it with what can best", 
    "be described as Keynesian policies, and we&#39;ll", 
    "talk more about that in future videos.", 
    "In fact, I should probably devote many", 
    "videos to Keynesian policies. It&#39;s the general idea", 
    "that the government might be able to turn around", 
    "a recession by sparking demand. The way", 
    "that it would spark demand is try to put", 
    "more money in people&#39;s pockets, or even", 
    "in businesses&#39; pockets. It would do that", 
    "through some combination of increased", 
    "government spending, maybe somehow giving money", 
    "to the poor, some types of transfer programs,", 
    "and tax cuts for people and for businesses", 
    "so that they have more money to spend.", 
    "These policies get implemented and over",

    "These are all of the things that you want in an economy.", 
    "Unfortunately, this is just kind of a sad human event,", 
    "in 1963, John F. Kennedy, you probably know,", 
    "is assassinated. Then his Vice President,", 
    "Lyndon Baines Johnson, that is LBJ right over there,",

    "He inherits a very, very good economy; almost,", 
    "one could argue, a perfect economy.", 
    "If Keynesian policies were really to be practiced", 
    "here to their full idea, in theory, once", 
    "the economy started to get a little bit really", 
    "overheated and really approaching its potential,", 
    "in maybe 1964-1965, the government maybe should have", 
    "started to pull back a little bit on its spending", 
    "so that the economy doesn&#39;t get overheated.", 
    "But Lyndon Baines Johnson did not do this.", 
    "He kept things going, and in fact he added more", 
    "fuel to the fire. One could argue that some of it", 
    "was driven by geopolitics. A major factor was", 
    "right over here, the Vietnam War, which was", 
    "escalated in a major way under LBJ&#39;s administration.", 
    "JFK was already dabbling in Vietnam, but it", 
    "became a really major war for the United States", 
    "under Lyndon Baines Johnson.", 
    "So some combination of Vietnam, and he had a huge", 
    "number of social programs, increased government", 
    "spending, to try to ease inequality in the U.S. as well,", 
    "so social programs. One could call it guns and butter.", 
    "Social programs to try to ease inequality.", 
    "The net effect of this is government spending", 
    "even though the economy was already red hot,", 
    "it was already at its potential, he wanted", 
    "to increase government spending even more,", 
    "so he kind of took it beyond its potential.", 
    "He made it overheat a little bit and what happens", 
    "in 1966 and onwards is that you have inflation", 
    "starting to grow at a fairly uncomfortable rate.", 
    "Inflation starts to grow dramatically.", 
    "Just to get a sense of it, when I keep saying", 
    "that the economy was at its potential and maybe", 
    "he might have taken a little bit of his pedal", 
    "off the gas, or his foot off of the pedal,", 
    "I should say, is as we get into the beginning", 
    "of his administration, 1964-1965, unemployment", 
    "is in the 4-5% range. Inflation is in the 1-2% range.", 
    "GDP is growing at a very healthy rate.", 
    "Despite that, and maybe he could argue", 
    "maybe his hand was forced by geopolitical events", 
    "especially on military funding, the government", 
    "continues to even spend more money, stimulates things", 
    "even more because that money goes to soldiers&#39;", 
    "salaries, it goes to companies that provide,", 
    "I guess that make napalm or make boats or make", 
    "whatever else. All of these government programs", 
    "inject even more dollars into the economy,", 
    "and so you ended up with inflation. The economy", 
    "was already operating at close to capacity", 
    "and it made it go maybe even beyond its", 
    "natural capacity. Let&#39;s see whether our", 
    "ADAS model would make, would allow for this to happen,", 
    "or would describe this, or would predict this",

    "Let me scroll down a little bit.", 
    "This right over here is real GDP.",

    "you could say that the U.S. is performing", 
    "at its potential GDP. When I talk about", 
    "its potential GDP, I&#39;m saying that on the long run,", 
    "assuming that people aren&#39;t overworked,",

    "to produce more. One could view this as", 
    "a theoretical maximum. When we talk about potential", 
    "we&#39;re not talking about that short term", 
    "theoretical maximum, we&#39;re talking about",
