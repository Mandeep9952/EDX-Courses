    "And just at a very high level,", 
    "a bond is essentially a way for someone", 
    "to participate in lending to a company,", 
    "so you&#39;re a partial lender,", 
    "partial lender,", 
    "to a company,", 
    "and just to make that more concrete,",

    "assets,", 
    "and it has $10 million in assets.", 
    "Let&#39;s say just for the sake of simplicity,", 
    "it has no liabilities,", 
    "so all of that value, all of that $10 million",

    "If we have a million shares,",

    "that implies that each share is worth $10 per share.", 
    "Now let&#39;s say this company is doing really well",

    "It wants another $5 million in assets", 
    "that it needs to build that factory,",

    "The question is,", 
    "how does it finance it?", 
    "Well, one way is they could just issue more equity.", 
    "If they&#39;re able to get a price of $10 per share,", 
    "they could issue another 500,000 shares,", 
    "500,000 shares at $10 per share,",

    "it would produce $5 million.", 
    "This is scenario one.", 
    "They issue 500,000 shares at $10 a share.", 
    "They now have 1.5 million shares,",

    "$5 million dollars,", 
    "so this, the equity would grow by $5 million.", 
    "We now have 1.5 million shares,",

    "not one million,", 
    "and that new money from these new shareholders", 
    "would go into the asset side,",

    "What I just described is essentially issuing equity,",

    "Financing via equity,", 
    "or by issuing stock.", 
    "Now, the other way to do it", 
    "is to borrow the money,", 
    "to borrow the money,", 
    "so let me redraw this company.", 
    "I&#39;ll leave this up here just so we can compare the two.", 
    "Once again, we have $10 million of assets.", 
    "That&#39;s our $10 million of assets.", 
    "We have $10 million of equity to start off with,",

    "we&#39;re going to borrow the money", 
    "so we could, we&#39;re essentially issuing debt,", 
    "so we issue,", 
    "we essentially could go to a bank and say,", 
    "&quot;Hey, bank. Can I borrow $5 million?&quot;", 
    "So we would have a $5 million liability,", 
    "it would be debt.", 
    "$5 million of debt,", 
    "and the bank would give us $5 million of cash", 
    "that we can then go use to buy our factory.", 
    "So in either situation,", 
    "in either situation,", 
    "the asset side of our balance sheet looks identical",

    "the people that I&#39;m borrowing this money,", 
    "this is borrowed money,", 
    "borrowed money.", 
    "They don&#39;t get a cut of the profits of this company.", 
    "What they do is they get paid interest", 
    "on their money that they&#39;re lending to us", 
    "before these guys get any profits at all.", 
    "In fact, that interest is considered an expense,",

    "&quot;Why don&#39;t I borrow it from 5,000 entities?&quot;", 
    "What I can do instead,", 
    "instead of borrowing it from one entity,", 
    "I could issue these certificates. I could issue bonds.", 
    "That&#39;s the topic of this video.", 
    "I issue these certificates.", 
    "They have a face value of $1,000.", 
    "$1,000. This is my face value.", 
    "Face value,", 
    "or sometimes you&#39;ll hear the notion of par value,", 
    "of par value,", 
    "and I&#39;ll say what interest I&#39;m going to pay on it,", 
    "so let&#39;s say I say it has a 10% annual coupon,", 
    "annual coupon,", 
    "and it&#39;s actually called,", 
    "even though this is the interest,", 
    "I&#39;m essentially going to pay $100 a year.", 
    "It&#39;s called a coupon because when they,", 
    "when bonds were first issued,", 
    "they would actually throw these little coupons", 
    "on the bond itself,", 
    "and the owner of the certificate could rip off", 
    "or cut off one of these coupons,", 
    "and then go to the person borrowing,", 
    "or the entity borrowing the money,", 
    "and get their actual interest payment.", 
    "That&#39;s why it&#39;s actually called &quot;coupons&quot;,", 
    "but they don&#39;t actually attach those coupons anymore.", 
    "And it has some maturity date,", 
    "the date that not only will I pay your interest back,", 
    "but I&#39;ll pay the entire principle,", 
    "the entire face value,", 
    "so let&#39;s say the maturity,", 
    "maturity is in two years,", 
    "is in two years.", 
    "In this situation,", 
    "in order to raise $5 million,", 
    "i&#39;m going to have to issue 5,000 of these", 
    "because 5,000 times 1,000 is 5 million,", 
    "so times 5,000.", 
    "If you wanted to lend $1,000 to this company", 
    "so that they could expand,", 
    "and if you think 10% is a good interest rate,", 
    "and it&#39;s a safe company,", 
    "you would essentially buy one of these bonds.", 
    "Maybe you buy it for $1,000,",

    "Now just to be clear how the actual payments work.", 
    "The coupons tend to get paid semi-annually,",

    "What is this,", 
    "if you own, if you hold this bond, this certificate,", 
    "what do you get?", 
    "Well, it&#39;s going to pay you 10% annually,", 
    "so $100 a year.", 
    "$100 per year.", 
    "But they actually pay the coupons semi-annually,", 
    "so you get $100 a year,", 
    "but you get half of it every 6 months,", 
    "so you&#39;re going to get $50 after 6 months.", 
    "You&#39;re going to get $50 after 12 months,", 
    "or after another 6 months.", 
    "You&#39;re going to get another $50 here.", 
    "You&#39;re going to get a final $50 there,", 
    "and they&#39;re also going to have to pay you back", 
    "the original amount of the loan.", 
    "They&#39;re also going to have to pay you the $1,000,", 
    "so that last payment&#39;s going to be the coupon of 50", 
    "plus the $1,000,", 
    "and so you will have essentially been getting", 
    "this 10% annual interest.", 
    "Now, when the company does this,", 
    "they&#39;ll probably have to issue some type of new bond", 
    "because all of a sudden,", 
    "they have to pay all of these people", 
    "this huge lump sum of money", 
    "if they haven&#39;t been able to earn it", 
    "from the factories yet,", 
    "and we could talk about that in a future video."
