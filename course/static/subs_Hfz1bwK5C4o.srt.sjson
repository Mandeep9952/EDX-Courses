    "and that&#39;s going to go to the owner of the firm,", 
    "who happens to be this guy right over here.", 
    "So the profit is $500 and so his total income is $3,500,", 
    "$3,500 and it&#39;s good that his income", 
    "is at least $3,500 because that&#39;s how much he&#39;s", 
    "spending it per month, spending per month.", 
    "Now the whole reason why I did this is to kind of show you", 
    "the circular flow of goods and services.", 
    "These are the goods and services up here.", 
    "Let me show ... These are the goods and services.", 
    "Goods and services.", 
    "The firms provide the households goods and services", 
    "and then the households are providing the firms,", 
    "the factors of production.", 
    "And sometimes you might say,", 
    "&quot;Well, aren&#39;t other firms also providing&quot;", 
    "&quot;the factors of production?&quot;", 
    "Yes, other firms could if there were other firms but", 
    "those firms at the end of the day are owned by someone.", 
    "They are getting their factors of production", 
    "by some household or they are owned by some household.", 
    "So you can view it as at the end of the day,", 
    "the households are really giving the firms", 
    "the factors of production.", 
    "Factors ... Factors of production.", 
    "At an exchange for the factors of production,", 
    "the households in exchange for giving these things,", 
    "the firms give the households income,", 
    "essentially rents on the different factors of production", 
    "that are being given to the firm for the most part", 
    "and over here in exchange for the goods and services,", 
    "the households are making expenditures", 
    "that can also be considered revenue of the firm.", 
    "Now, if you were an economist that were to observe this", 
    "and I guess if we&#39;re to focus on this island maybe", 
    "he would also have to be the island economist", 
    "and you would say, &quot;How would you measure ... &quot;", 
    "&quot;How would you measure the total ... the total value of the", 
    "&quot;product ... production of my country here?&quot;,", 
    "maybe we could call it the Gross Domestic Product.", 
    "How would we measure it?", 
    "Would you count just the total expenditures or", 
    "would you count the total expenditures and the total income", 
    "or would you even count that and the revenue?", 
    "Well if you counted all of that,", 
    "you would be essentially triple counting.", 
    "If you counted the total revenue, the total expenditures", 
    "and the total income, they are all about $3,500.", 
    "You would be triple counting.", 
    "So what you could do, you could just measure", 
    "only one of these things.", 
    "You could say your GDP, your Gross Domestic Product,", 
    "your Gross Domestic Product is the total expenditures", 
    "by the households. So it would be the $3,500.", 
    "You could say it is the total income by the households,", 
    "so that would also be $3,500 and the total revenue", 
    "really is the same thing as the total expenditures.", 
    "So the whole point of this video and this is, obviously,", 
    "a very artificial case where we&#39;re dealing with an island", 
    "with only one person and he&#39;s essentially renting out his", 
    "own labor by using this firm as some type of vehicle.", 
    "He&#39;s consuming his own labor.", 
    "He&#39;s renting out a house from a firm", 
    "that he has rented his house to.", 
    "So it is very, very, very circular but hopefully this", 
    "appreciate ... you kind of appreciate", 
    "how the resources are going around", 
    "in this kind of a circular flow."
