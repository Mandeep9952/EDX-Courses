    <p>The PPC is a model used to show the tradeoffs associated with allocating resources between the production of two goods. The PPC can be used to illustrate the concepts of scarcity, opportunity cost, efficiency, inefficiency, economic growth, and contractions.</p>
    <p>For example, suppose Carmen splits her time as a carpenter between making tables and building bookshelves. The PPC would show the maximum amount of either tables or bookshelves she could build given her current resources, and the shape of the PPC would indicate whether she had increasing, decreasing, or constant opportunity costs.</p>

    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Key model</h1>
    <img src="/static/image1.svg" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">
    <p>The Production Possibilities Curve (PPC) is a model that captures scarcity and the opportunity costs of choices when faced with the possibility of producing two goods or services. Points on the interior of the PPC are inefficient, points on the PPC are efficient, and points beyond the PPC are unattainable. The opportunity cost of moving from one efficient combination of production to another efficient combination of production is how much of one good is given up in order to get more of the other good. </p>
    <p>The shape of the PPC also gives us information on the production technology (in other words, how the resources are combined to produce these goods). The bowed out shape of the PPC in Figure 1111 indicates that there are increasing opportunity costs of production.</p>
    <p>We can also use the PPC model to illustrate economic growth, which is represented by a shift of the PPC. Figure 2222 illustrates an agent that has experienced economic growth. Combinations that were once impossible, such as 6 iPads and 4 watches, are now on the new PPC, thanks to the increase in resources or technology.</p>
    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Key Equations and Calculations: Calculating opportunity costs:</h1>
    <p>To find the opportunity cost of any good X in terms of the units of Y given up, we use the following formula:</p>
    <p>Opportunity cost of each unit of good X=(Y1−Y2)÷(X1−X2) units of good Y</p>
    <a href="#">[Show Me How to Calculate Opportunity Costs]</a>
    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Common Misperceptions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>Not all costs are monetary costs. Opportunity costs are expressed in terms of how much of another good, service, or activity must be given up in order to pursue or produce another activity or good. For example, when you head out to see a movie, the cost of that activity is not just the price of a movie ticket, but the value of the next best alternative, such as cleaning your room.</li>
      <li>Going from an inefficient amount of production to an efficient amount of production is not economic growth. For example, suppose an economy can make two goods: chocolate donuts and cattle prods. But half of their donut machines aren’t being used, so they aren’t fully using all of their resources. Graphically, that would be represented by a combination of goods in the interior of their PPC. If they then put all of those donut machines to work, they aren’t acquiring more resources (which is what we mean by economic growth). Instead, they are just using their resources more efficiently and moving to a new point on the PPC.</li>
      <li>On the other hand, if this economy is making as many donuts and cattle prods as it can, and it acquires more donut machines, it has experienced economic growth because it now has more resources (in this case, capital) available. This would be represented in a PPC graph as a shift outward of the entire PPC curve.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Discussion Questions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>How would you show with a PPC that a country has constant opportunity costs of production?</li>
      <li>Using a correctly labeled PPC model, show an economy that has increasing opportunity costs that can produce cattle prods and chocolate donuts that is underutilizing its labor.</li>
