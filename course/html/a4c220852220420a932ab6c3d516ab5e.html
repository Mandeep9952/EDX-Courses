    <p>Absolute advantage describes a situation in which an individual, business or country can produce more of a good or service than any other producer with the same quantity of resources. </p>
    <p>The United States, for example, has a skilled workforce, abundant natural resources, and advanced technology. Because of these three things, the US can produce many goods more efficiently than potential trading partners, giving it an absolute advantage in the production of goods from corn to computers, to maple syrup and cars. This does not, however, mean that the US does not benefit from trading for these goods with other nations.</p>
    <p>Comparative advantage describes a situation in which an individual, business or country can produce a good or service at a lower opportunity cost than another producer. </p>
    <p>For example, because it has an abundance of maple trees, Canada can produce maple syrup at a very low opportunity cost in relation to avocados, a fruit for which its climate is less suited. </p>
    <p>Mexico, on the other hand, with its ample sunshine and warm climate. can grow avocados at a much lower opportunity cost in terms of maple syrup given up than Canada.</p>
    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Speciallization</h1>
    <p>Production specialization according to comparative advantage, not absolute advantage, results in exchange opportunities that lead to consumption opportunities beyond the PPC. Trade between two agents or countries allows the countries to enjoy a higher total output and level of consumption than what would have been possible domestically. </p>
    <p>Canada and Mexico can each specialize in the good they have a comparative advantage in and exchange with one another. This lets both countries enjoy more maple syrup and avocados than they could have enjoyed without trade. Mexico will export avocados and import maple syrup; this way Mexicans can enjoy their tasty breakfasts and Canadians will enjoy delicious guacamole!</p>
    <p>Comparative advantage and opportunity costs determine the terms of trade for exchange under which mutually beneficial trade can occur. </p>
    <p>In order for Canadians to benefit from trade with Mexico, they must be able to import avocados at a lower opportunity cost than it would cost them to grow domestically. Likewise, Mexico must get maple syrup more cheaply (in terms of avocados given up) than it could have produced it for domestically. The terms of trade refer to the trading price agreed upon by two agents, which when beneficial, will allow both countries to enjoy gains from trade.</p>

    <p>PPCs can be used to determine opportunity costs, comparative advantage, and who should specialize in which good (as in Figure 1). </p>
    <img src="/static/bf3f049f660492ac9ead572633a9bc9861606950.svg" style="display:block;margin-left:auto;margin-right:auto;">

    <p>The gains from trade can be shown in a PPC by drawing a line originating at the point on the axis on which an agent is specializing its production (in the good it has a comparative advantage in) out to a point on the opposite axis beyond what it could have achieved without trade.</p>
    <p>Assuming terms of trade are beneficial (e.g. offering each agent a lower opportunity cost than could be achieved without trade) an individual or country will be able to consume at a point beyond its PPC through specialization and trade (as in Figure 2).</p>

    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Common Misperceptions</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>A country that has an absolute advantage in producing all goods still stands to benefit from trade with other countries, since the basis of the gains for trade is comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.</li>
      <li>It is not possible for an individual or country to have a comparative advantage in all goods. There will be some other individual or country that can produce some things at lower opportunity costs.</li>
      <li>"Self-sufficiency" is not necessarily a trait to be strived for in the global economy. Individuals or nations who try to produce everything for themselves are likely to end up poorer than those that engage in specialization and trade.</li>
    </ul>
    <h1 style="color:maroon;margin-left:40px;">Discussion questions</h1>
    <ol>
      <li>In what circumstances might a country NOT benefit from trade with another country? [Explain]</li>
      <li>Economist Russell Roberts once wrote, "Self-sufficiency is the road to poverty." Discuss how the principle of specialization and trade based on comparative advantage supports this claim.</li>
      <li>The table below shows the production possibilities of two countries, Tonju and Emria, of two goods, smartphones and apples, given a fixed amount of resources.</li>

      <li>Which country has the absolute advantage in smartphones and which has the absolute advantage in apples?</li>
      <li> Calculate Tonju’s opportunity cost of smartphones in terms of apples</li>
      <li>If the two countries were to specialize and trade with one another, which country would import smartphones?</li>
      <li>Assume the countries decide to specialize and trade and settled on a trading price of 2.5 smartphones per apple. Explain why the country that specializes in apples would experience gains from trade.</li>
