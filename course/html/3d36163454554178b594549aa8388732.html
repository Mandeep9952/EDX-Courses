<div class="paragraph">Alas, nothing is perfect. And GDP is no exception. As much as economists like to use GDP as a measure of output, or even as a measure of a country&rsquo;s well being, GDP has some limitations when trying to answer those questions. GDP leaves out some production in an economy, such as the squash your mom might grow in the backyard, or other non-marketed goods. Even though GDP is frequently used to capture the wellbeing of a society, it was never intended to do that, and as a result it leaves out important aspects of well-being like pollution or even happiness.</div>

<h3>The limitations of GDP</h3>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="2">
<div class="paragraph">GDP is a useful indicator of a nation&rsquo;s economic performance, and it is the most commonly used measure of well-being. However, it has some important limitations, including:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="3">
<ul>
<li>The exclusion of non-market transactions</li>
<li>The failure to account for or represent the degree of income inequality in society</li>
<li>The failure to indicate whether the nation&rsquo;s rate of growth is sustainable or not</li>
<li>The failure to account for the costs imposed on human health and the environment of negative externalities arising from the production or consumption of the nation&rsquo;s output</li>
<li>Treating the replacement of depreciated capital the same as the creation of new capital</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="4">
<div class="paragraph">Alternative indicators have been developed to provide a more well-rounded measure of a nation&rsquo;s quality of life by different national and international organizations. These include:</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="5">
<ul>
<li>The Human Development Index (HDI)</li>
<li>The Genuine Progress Indicator (GPI)</li>
<li>The Happy Planet Index (HPI)</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="6">
<div class="paragraph">Each of these indexes is a composite measure weighing both income and non-income variables such as life expectancy, literacy rates, environmental indicators, measures of inequality and so on. By including these variables, they provide a measure of life quality that goes beyond the narrowness of a nation&rsquo;s GDP value.</div>

<h2>Common misperceptions</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1">
<ul>
<li>Some people mistakenly think a higher income (and larger GDP) is correlated with a higher quality of life and more happiness, but only up to a certain income level. Some studies have actually found that beyond a certain income level, additional increases in income are no longer correlated with higher quality of life. Instead, other, non-income factors (such as the equity of income distribution and access to education and health-care) are more closely correlated with a happier, healthier society.</li>
<li>Some of the poorest countries in the world may actually appear poorer than they really are if we only consider their official GDP figures. If a large percentage of the workforce is employed in the informal sector, then their incomes will not be reflected in the nation&rsquo;s GDP. As a result, the nation&rsquo;s GDP will appear smaller than it would be if all economic activity were included.</li>

<h2>Discussion questions</h2>
</div>
<div class="paragraph" data-perseus-paragraph-index="1"><ol start="1">
<li>
<div class="paragraph">Do higher incomes and more output always equal a higher quality of life for the people experiencing such growth? Explain.</div>

<li>
<div class="paragraph">Under what circumstances would an increase in a nation's average income <em>not</em> lead to an increase in the income of the typical, median household?</div>

<li>
<div class="paragraph">Choose an alternative measure of well-being and describe what it includes.

<div class="paragraph">The Human Development Index is a measure that was developed by economist Mahbub ul Haq with the goal of shifting attention away from measures like GDP to a more people-centric measure of well-being. Its uses measured that are meant to capture three dimensions of well-being: a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living.</div>
